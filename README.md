# Python-Programming

> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.

> It follows the principle of “batteries included”, meaning it comes with a rich standard library that simplifies development across multiple domains.

> Python code is written in .py files and executed by the Python interpreter directly, making it easy to test and debug without compilation.

> It supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming, making it highly adaptable for different problem-solving approaches.

> Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, scripting, and software prototyping, making it one of the most popular languages in modern software development.
